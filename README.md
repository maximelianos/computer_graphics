## Computer graphics

These are all Computer Graphics projects that I completed in Moscow State University. All of them were written from scratch without any existing code templates. Each project has its own readme.

1. Raytracing: rendering one frame with the ray tracing approach, instead of traditional triangle projection, in C++.
2. Water surface simulation: simulation of a water surface in C++ and OpenGL.
3. Conway: game of life in C++ and OpenGL.
3. Convolutional neural network on CUDA: CUDA C++ program to execute a trained image denoiser from Keras.
4. SDF: signed distance field rendering in Rust.
5. Diff2D: differential render of 2D scene.
